## About Me

I am currently a doctoral student in the Department of Engineering Science at [University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Alison Noble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Noble)). I received my Masters (MASc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, Canada, where I was a graduate research assistant in the Human Communication Technologies Laboratory (HCT Lab), supervised by Prof. Sidney Fels. I was awarded the prestigious Young Scientist Award by MICCAI Society for my work on deep learning-based silent speech interfaces.

During my master's, I also worked with Prof. Bryan Gick, the director of UBC Interdisciplinary Speech Research Lab (ISRL) and the head of Department of Linguistics, UBC as well as Prof. Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, the director of UBC Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lab. Besides being a graduate research assistant, I also acted as the Treasurer and Executive Committee Member (2018-2020) of the ECE Graduate Student Association (ECEGSA).

Before joining the HCT Lab, I was a MITACS Globalink Research Intern in the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, University of Alberta, Edmonton, advised by Dr. Lawrence Le. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) degree in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, my final year project being under Prof. Amitava Chatterjee. During my junior year, I interned on the 3D Medical Image Processing area, in the Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Kgp), jointly supervised by Prof. Sudipta Mukhopadhyay and Prof. Ashis Kumar Dhara. In my senior year, I worked as a research intern in the Tomography Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering, at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc Bangalore) under Prof. Kasi Rajgopal.

My current research primarily centers around **medical image analysis**, **computer vision**, and **deep learning** -- with a special focus on solving challenges in decentralized training of machine learning models on: (a) class-imbalanced data distributions, and (b) in absence of labels. My research interests include **federated learning**, **self-supervised learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **Speech Motor Control**, and **Brain-Computer Interfaces**.
